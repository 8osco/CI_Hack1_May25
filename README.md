# Healthcare Insurance Cost Analysis

This is a study on how personal attributes and geographic factors influence insurance charges based on a healthcare insurance dataset extracted from Kaggle.

## Dataset Content
The dataset contains information on the relationship between personal attributes (age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits) and geographic factors and their impact on medical insurance charges.  This can be downloaded from the link below.

## Business Requirements
1) Display basic statistics, including average insurance charges by age, gender and region.
2) Visualise correlations between different attributes and insurance charges.
3) Geographic Analysis: Visualise the impact of geographic regions on insurance charges.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
Insurance charge is expected to: 

1) increase with age
2) be higher for smoker
3) be lower for female
4) vary with BMI

Family size may also be a contributing factor to insurance charges.

We will examine and validate through analyses and visualisations that are set out under the business requirements.


## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?




## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?


## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

# talk about need of testing packages in advance e.g. for plotly and what were learnt!!!

## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
